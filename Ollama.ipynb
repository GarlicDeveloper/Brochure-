      "tangible real-world problems\n",
      "faced by everyone. I loved that we had billboard ads in train stations and we got to speak to our end-users every day. One of my proudest moments: at an Amazon pitch event to people in tech, we were voted the ‘startup most likely to grow exponentially’.\n",

We help recruiters source, understand, engage and manage talent, using Generative AI and other forms of machine learning. Our\\npatented\\nmodel matches people with roles with greater accuracy and speed than previously imaginable — no keywords required. Take a look for yourself; it’s completely free to try.\\nOur long term goal is to help people discover their potential and pursue their reason for being, motivated by a concept called\\nIkigai\\n. We help people find roles where they will be most fulfilled and successful; as a result, we will raise the level of human prosperity. It sounds grandiose, but since 77% of people don’t consider themselves\\ninspired or engaged\\nat work, it’s completely within our reach.\\nI sometimes have to pinch myself. I’m incredibly lucky to be working in the field of AI at a time when it’s rewriting the boundaries of human and tech possibilities. I’m personally most drawn to applying AI to real world problems, and the specific problem of hiring has plagued me throughout my career. So I’m in the business of finding people their dream jobs — and conveniently, I’m in my dream job myself.\\nBefore Nebula.io\\nYou can trace the roots of Nebula.io to an AI startup I founded in 2013 called\\nuntapt\\n. We built talent marketplaces and data science software for recruitment firms. To start with, we specialized on tech roles in financial services, '"
